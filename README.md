# dapnet-ntfygateway

Full documentation to follow!

## What is it?

Ultimately, this is designed to be installed on an MMDVM node running [Pi-star](http://www.pistar.uk/) or [WPSD](https://wpsd.radio/).

It sits and reads the logfile located at:

`/var/log/pi-star/DAPNETGateway-yyyy-mm-dd.log`

... extracts information relating to pages received that are intended for you (or a fellow Amateur operator), and then forwards that page through to a [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) topic so that they can be received on the official ntfy.sh app or picked up by another script that is subscribed to that topic.

## Why?

Because:

* you may not always have your pager with you
* you may not always be in range of a DAPNET transmitter
* you may be using the DAPNET Telegram bot, which only works on a handful of transmitter groups (and specifically _not_ `uk-all`)
* why not?

## Installation

*You should only ever need to do this once - unless you totally b0rk it!*

You'll need SSH access to your MMDVM node.  Start off by making sure you have the correct software installed to run this script:

```shell
sudo apt install git python3
```

It's likely you'll already have `python3` installed, but it doesn't hurt to check.  It's also kinda necessary.

Now download and setup the environment for the tool:

```shell
# create the folder for the script and download it
mkdir -P ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/thelovebug/dapnet-ntfygateway
cd dapnet-ntfygateway

# setup the environment to run it and download dependencies
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python install -r requirements.txt
```

There, all installed.  Next thing is to prep your config file:

```shell
# copy the sample config into the live location
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Now edit your config.json file in your favourite text editor.  The bits to change are self-explanatory, but here's a guide:

```json
    "profiles": {
        "anyname": {                            # change anyname to something that helps you identify this profile - your DMR ID perhaps?
            "ric": "your-ric",                  # change your-ric to the RIC provided by DAPNET, it's usually a variation on your DMR ID
            "call": "your-callsign",            # change your-callsign to - guess what? - your callsign, case isn't important
            "endpoint": "your-ntfy-endpoint",   # change your-ntfy-endpoint, it'll start with https://ntfy.sh/ - check that website for info
            "enabled": true,                    # everything else can stay as is for now
            "alertoncall": true,
            "messagetypes": [
                "M",
                "E",
                "I",
                "D"
            ]
        }
    }
```

You're ready to go!

## Running the script

To kick the script off, enter the following command:

``` shell
./monitor_start.sh
```

This will start the process in a detached `screen` session.  If you want to know if it's still running, I may make a better invocation tool in the future.  For now, just run the same script again and it'll tell you if it's still running.

If you want to make sure that this script starts on boot, then use the following command:

```shell
./monitor_cron add
```

Good luck, and reach out to me (via [QRZ](https://qrz.com/db/M7TLB)) if you have any issues.

## To do

* ~~Document the installation process~~ Done, kinda.
* Document the `config.json` file
* Error handling - like, any!
* Expand the informational message scope to include DAPNET network connection status
* Profit!!
